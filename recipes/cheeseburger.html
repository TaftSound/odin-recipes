<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ground beef</li>
    <li>Buns</li>
    <li>American cheese</li>
    <li>Condiments</li>
    <li>Mayo</li>
    <li>Mustard</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong> Prepare Patties </strong> – Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 
        equal portions (3 oz each), cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong> Make Sauce </strong> – Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong> Prep Toppings </strong> – fully prep your toppings ahead to assemble the 
        burgers right away while the patties are hot and juicy off the grill.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong> Toast buns </strong> – lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on a 
        griddle or skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Transfer to a rack.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong> patties </strong> – increase to medium-high heat. Depending on your surface area, 
        place 2 to 4 cold pieces of meat onto the hot surface. Working quickly, 
        cover each piece with a sheet of parchment paper and smash each into a thin 
        patty. Remove parchment paper, season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, 
        add a dab of sauce, and flip. Sear for 2 minutes on the first side and about 
        a minute on the second side.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Add cheese </strong> – place a slice of cheese onto half of the patties and top with a 
        second patty and remove from heat. Serve warm over toasted buns with toppings.
